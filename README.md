# MultiSCED
A Shiny tool for multilevel modeling of singe-case experimental design data

ABOUT

The MultiSCED web application has been developed to assist practitioners to apply multilevel modeling on their single-case experimental design (SCED) data. The tool leads applied researchers step by step through a workflow leading up to a full multilevel (meta-)analysis of their single-case experimental data. With the app the user can prepare his or her data, conduct analyses, and interpret the results using statistical methods implemented in R. A straightforward point-and-click interface, developed within the Shiny framework, is provided to make the R functionality readily available.
